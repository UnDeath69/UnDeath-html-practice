      The Toyota Supra MK4 (A80), especially when modified, is one of the most
      iconic tuner cars ‚Äî here are several things to know about it, its
      strengths, what people do to modify it, and what to watch out for: Key
      Stock Highlights Engine: The famous 2JZ series engines. The turbocharged
      version is the 2JZ-GTE (twin-turbo), naturally aspirated version is
      2JZ-GE. CARS24 +2 eManualOnline +2 Transmission: Turbo models often came
      with the 6-speed Getrag V160 manual, which is very desirable.
      eManualOnline +2 CARS24 +2 Chassis / build quality: Very strong block
      (cast iron), good headwork potential, relatively ‚Äúoverbuilt‚Äù in many
      areas‚Äîwhich is why modded ones tend to handle big power well. MotorVerso
      +2 CARS24 +2 Common Modifications People Do To turn a Supra MK4 into a
      high performance beast, modders often do the following: Area Typical
      Modifications Gains / Why It‚Äôs Done Engine / Power - Upgraded turbos
      (single large turbo or bigger twins) - Better fueling: bigger injectors,
      fuel pumps - ECU / standalone engine management - Supporting mods:
      intercoolers, exhaust, downpipe, intake - Internal strength upgrades
      (forged pistons, rods, etc.) when aiming high HP MotorVerso +4 Fast Car +4
      tuningblog.eu +4 More power, better responsiveness, higher top end;
      without these, high boost alone can damage parts. Chassis / Suspension /
      Wheels Coilovers (adjustable), sway bars, upgraded control arms, bushings.
      Wider wheels / tires for traction. Sometimes upgraded brakes (big
      calipers, large rotors). tuningblog.eu +2 Fast Car +2 To handle the power,
      improve handling, reduce wheel-hop, increase cornering grip. Aero & Body
      Wide-body kits (Veilside, Ridox, BN Sports etc.), front splitters, rear
      wings, side skirts. Use of carbon fiber for weight saving / styling. Fast
      Car +2 tuningblog.eu +2 Better downforce (if done well), better cooling
      (air-flow), and the show/car culture aspect. Interior / Miscellaneous
      Upgraded seats (racing or highly supportive ones), steering wheels, better
      gauges, sometimes roll cages, improved audio. Also enhancing cooling (oil
      coolers, better radiator, etc.) Fast Car +2 tuningblog.eu +2 Comfort,
      safety, and making the car more usable, especially if pushing the limits.
      What Makes It Special / Why It‚Äôs Loved Potential for huge power: Because
      of the strong block, good headroom for forced induction, etc., many Supra
      MK4s with proper mods make 500-800 hp (or even more). Some builds go much
      higher. tuningblog.eu +3 CarCollectionWorld.com +3 MotorVerso +3 Cult
      status: Thanks to pop culture (Fast & Furious etc.), its appearance, the
      inline-6 sound, reliability, and tuning community. tuningblog.eu +2
      MotorVerso +2 Good parts availability (globally): Many aftermarket
      companies produce parts, so modding options are wide. Although some
      specific OEM parts have become rarer. Reddit +1 Things to Watch Out For /
      Challenges Reliability risks, especially with heavily modified examples:
      Poor assembly, tuning, or neglect can lead to engine, cooling, or
      drivetrain failures. If the car has been modified, you‚Äôll want good
      documentation and ideally dyno data. CarCollectionWorld.com +2 Reddit +2
      Cost to maintain: Upgraded parts, fuel, servicing, insurance all cost
      more. Also, finding skilled mechanics for high-level tuning and
      trouble-shooting can be harder. Legal / emissions / compliance: In many
      countries, heavily modified cars may face regulatory issues (noise,
      emissions, safety). Weight and handling: Mods can add weight (wide wheels,
      aero, etc.) while too much power without proper suspension/brakes can make
      the car difficult or unsafe to drive.
